# Keras Dog-Cat Image Classification
## Project Summary 
* This project is to provide a detailed explanation of applying convolutional neural network (CNN) for a classification task of classifying dogs vs cats by using the Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).
* There are two CNN models including Manually built CNN model (Model 1) and Customised pre-trained CNN model suing the VGG16 architecture (Model 2).
* Model 1 has an accuracy of 76.48%, meanwhile, Model 2 has an accuracy of 93.12%.
* Full report is available via this [link](https://github.com/dukele35/image_classification_keras_pretrained_CNNs/blob/master/report.pdf)

## Technology
* Python
* Keras

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Use Jupyter Notebook Environment then run `CNN1.ipynb` for Model 1 or `CNN2.ipynb` for Model 2. 
3. Use saved models' files including `cnn1.h5` for Model 1 or `cnn2.h5` for Model 2 to use the models directly and to save training time which could take several hours especially for Model 2.
